# Rekall - Design Document

Status: label, title and description on projects and tasks; notes shared across tasks; one
wrapup per task, written by Claude and corrected by hand

Rekall stores the structure and the working context of the projects and tasks you work on, and
hands them to Claude Code over MCP. Claude reads all of it and writes one thing: the wrapup of
a task, which is what that task's implementation currently looks like.

---

## 1. Problem

A folder per project, a subfolder per issue, markdown files inside. It works because Claude Code
can read files, but:

- No structure. What a task belongs to exists only as prose repeated in every `CONTEXT.md`.
- Duplication. Cluster coordinates and credentials are copied across files and drift.
- Loading a task into context means naming the right files by hand, every time.
- Nothing says what the work currently *is*. Every session opens by reading the code back to
  find out what it already does, because the notes record how things were decided and never
  what they became.

Target: type `/rk project:vega task:report-builder-main-workflow` and have the full context
loaded in one call, including every note the task shares with its neighbours.

---

## 2. Decisions

| # | Decision | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| D1 | Real tables with real foreign keys | A note can never point at a deleted task. On an app whose only job is to be a reliable memory, silent dangling references are the failure mode that matters. |
| D2 | Claude reads everything and writes one thing | `rekall-mcp` depends on the domain and never on `rekall-api`, so no controller is on its classpath, and every read runs in a read-only transaction. The single exception is `rekall_wrapup`, which can replace one column of one row keyed by a task. See §7. |
| D3 | Markdown content lives in the database | One backup target, reachable through MCP, searchable. |
| D4 | One entry point, and it is a slash command | A session begins with `/rk project:vega task:report-builder`, not with a question. Reaching a record through a natural-language query costs several turns and a few thousand tokens before any work starts, and it is the part that fails when the model guesses the wrong entity. An explicit anchor removes both. |
| D5 | The model is fixed at compile time | There is no runtime meta-model and no DDL engine. Company, project, task and document are fixed JPA entities; adding a new kind of record is a class and a migration, not a screen. |
| D6 | Modular monolith, single process, embedded database | Single user, localhost. The application has to be reachable with one command or it will not get used. |
| D7 | What a record is called and what an anchor resolves are two columns | One column serving both jobs would mean a rename breaks anchors written down elsewhere, and makes every name a compromise between readable and typeable. `label` is a slug and is the identity; `title` is prose and is free. See §4. |
| D8 | A task carries one wrapup, and it is a state and not a log | The thing that costs a session its first twenty minutes is reconstructing what the code already does. A note cannot answer that: notes accumulate, and the reader has to synthesise the current state out of them. A wrapup is that synthesis, written once and overwritten thereafter. Its own table, because a document belongs to many tasks by construction and "one answer per task" has to be a constraint rather than a convention. See §4.1. |

Non-goals: multi-user, authentication, remote deployment, vector search.

## 3. Module structure

```
rekall/
  rekall-domain/   entities, repositories, context assembly, Liquibase changelogs
  rekall-api/      REST controllers for the UI
  rekall-mcp/      MCP server, one tool that reads and one that writes a wrapup
  rekall-app/      Spring Boot entry point, serves the built frontend
  rekall-ui/       Vue 3 + Vite (built into rekall-app/src/main/resources/static)
```

`rekall-mcp` must not depend on `rekall-api`. The two are independent consumers of the same
domain, which is what keeps the boundary structural rather than accidental: the only write
`rekall-mcp` can reach is `WrapupService`, and no controller, no `CatalogService` and no
`DocumentService` is on its classpath.

### Stack

| Component | Choice | Note |
|---|---|---|
| Runtime | Java 25 | |
| Framework | Spring Boot 4.1 | |
| Persistence | Spring Data JPA | One technology, no second query builder |
| Migrations | Liquibase | Portable types, so the door to PostgreSQL stays open |
| Database | H2, file | Embedded. No server to start |
| Boilerplate | Lombok | `annotationProcessorPaths` is declared explicitly: from JDK 23 javac no longer runs processors it merely finds on the classpath |
| MCP server | Hand-rolled | MCP over HTTP is three JSON-RPC methods and one POST endpoint |
| Frontend | Vue 3 + Vite | |
| Document editing | `md-editor-v3` | Toolbar over the markdown source, not a WYSIWYG. A WYSIWYG keeps its own tree and regenerates the source on every edit, and that source is what MCP hands to Claude verbatim |
| Tests | JUnit 5 against in-memory H2 | |

## 4. Model

```
Company ──< Project ──< Task >──< Document
                         │      (document_task)
                         └──1 Wrapup
```

| Table | Anchored by | Columns of note |
|---|---|---|
| `company` | `name`, unique | `description` |
| `project` | `label`, unique per company | `title`, `status`, `description`, `company_id` |
| `task` | `label`, unique per project | `title`, `status`, `description`, `project_id` |
| `document` | — | `title`, `kind`, `body_markdown` |
| `document_task` | — | `document_id`, `task_id`, `position` |
| `wrapup` | through its task | `task_id` unique, `body_markdown`, `written_by` |

`task.project_id` and `project.company_id` are both `ON DELETE CASCADE`: a project's tasks have
no meaning without it, and neither do a company's projects. The blast radius of deleting a
company is large, which makes it the interface's job to state it before anyone clicks.

### The label and the title are separate columns

`label` and `title` do two different jobs, kept in two columns:

| Column | Job | Constraint |
|---|---|---|
| `label` | What the anchor resolves | Slug: `^[a-z0-9]+([._-][a-z0-9]+)*$`. Unique inside its parent. Normalised on write by `Slug.of`, so `Report Builder` is stored as `report-builder` |
| `title` | What it is called on screen | Free text, `NOT NULL`. Changing it never moves an anchor |
| `description` | What it is about | Markdown, up to 100,000 characters. The brief the work is measured against, handed to Claude in a `<description>` tag on every context that loads the record |

Normalised rather than rejected: what someone types into a label field is a name, and what the
anchor needs is an identifier, and the two differ by punctuation and nothing else. Only a value
with nothing usable left in it is refused, as a 400.

The label is validated with `@Pattern` on the entity as well, so a write that bypasses the
service cannot leave an anchor the grammar cannot carry. Changing a label is allowed and moves
the anchor; nothing stored points at one, so what breaks is outside the application, and saying
so before the save is the interface's job.

Project labels are unique per company rather than globally, for the same reason task labels are
unique per project: two companies routinely have a project called `website`. A bare
`project:website` that matches twice is reported as ambiguous, resolvable with `company:acme`.

A note is attached to **at least one task and possibly many**. Cluster access, a naming
convention and an onboarding step are all notes of that kind.

The lower bound of one is enforced in the service and not in the database, because it is a rule
about what the interface may leave behind rather than about referential integrity: a note on no
task is unreachable, and no screen could show it again. Deleting a task therefore unlinks its
notes and sweeps up only the ones now attached to nothing.

`position` lives on the link, not on the note: the same note can sit first on one task and last
on another without the two orderings fighting.

Task labels are unique per project rather than globally, because two projects routinely have a
task with the same one. A bare `task:setup` that matches in two projects is reported as
ambiguous; `project:beacon task:setup` resolves it.

### 4.1 The wrapup

A wrapup is what a task's implementation looks like **now**. Claude writes one at the end of a
session with `/rk project:vega task:report-builder wrapup`, and reads it back at the start of the
next one, where it arrives with the task like everything else.

It is defined by what it is not. It is not a changelog: no "added", no "before/after", nothing
dated, nothing phrased as a step someone took. A sentence that only makes sense to a reader who
watched the change happen belongs in a note. The reason is the failure it replaces — twenty
minutes at the start of every session spent reading the code back to find out what it already
does, because the notes describe how things were decided and never what they became.

| Decision | Why |
|---|---|
| Its own table, not a `document` with `kind = 'wrapup'` | A document is attached to any number of tasks by construction. That is exactly the shape a wrapup must not have: there is one answer to "what does this task do now", and a row that could hang off three tasks is three answers waiting to disagree |
| `task_id` is `NOT NULL` and unique | "One per task" is then a constraint. A service check reads the table and then writes it, and the two writers this application now has can interleave between those two statements |
| Replaced whole, never appended to, no history | A wrapup that accumulated would become the log it is defined against. The previous version is not kept, which is the cost, and it is why overwriting one that was edited by hand is announced |
| Capped at 20,000 characters, against 100,000 for a note | The cap is where a wrapup that has turned into a log gets caught. If the state of the work does not fit on a screen, what is being written is the process |
| `written_by` is `CLAUDE` or `HAND`, stamped by the transport | The console cannot claim to be Claude and the tool cannot claim to be you: the API stamps `HAND` on anything arriving over HTTP and the tool stamps `CLAUDE` on anything arriving over MCP. A field a client could set is a field that says nothing |
| `ON DELETE CASCADE` on the task, unlike a note | A note may matter to other tasks and is unlinked. A wrapup describes one task and has no meaning anywhere else |

What is **not** enforced is the rule that matters most: that the text describes the state and not
the process. It is not checkable, and a heuristic that rejected the word "added" would be wrong
more often than right. It is stated in the three places it can be read — the tool description, the
slash command, and the empty state in the console — and the cap catches the failure mode it
produces.

## 5. Loading a context

`ContextService` is the whole of what Rekall does at read time. It resolves each anchor and
walks the associations, inside one read-only transaction, returning a materialised
`ContextRecord` tree. The tree is materialised so the MCP layer can render it without an open
session: handing entities to a renderer instead would make every field access a bet on whether
the session is still open.

The walk distinguishes by direction, not by depth:

| Direction | What is loaded | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Forward (`@ManyToOne`) | The record in full, **with its documents** | What this record depends on to be understood. Bounded by the model: a task reaches its project and stops |
| Inverse (`@OneToMany`) | Labels only, printed as anchors | What points back at this. Unbounded fan-out: a project has forty tasks |
| One-to-one (`wrapup`) | In full, in a tag of its own, ahead of the notes | Exactly one, so there is no fan-out to bound. Ahead of the notes because a session that opens on a task is asking what it does now, and the notes are the background to that answer |

Scalars are rendered as bullets and bodies as tags, which is why a description is a `<description>` block rather than a `description` bullet. It is a document, with headings, lists and a scope section, and a document inlined into a list item stops being one: every line after the first falls outside the bullet, and its own headings outrank the record's.

That distinction is why the two-anchor form exists. `/rk project:vega` loads the project and
lists its tasks as anchors; naming the task as a second anchor is how you narrow to one.

A note arriving with every task that references it is the point of the whole design. One row,
many links, is what lets a cluster note reach every task it belongs to without going stale in
any of its copies.

---

## 6. MCP server

Transport: HTTP on the same process as the UI.

```bash
claude mcp add --transport http rekall http://localhost:47355/mcp
```

Two tools. `rekall_context` reads, taking one string:

```json
{ "anchors": "project:vega task:report-builder-main-workflow" }
```

`rekall_wrapup` writes, taking the same anchors and the text:

```json
{ "anchors": "project:vega task:report-builder", "body": "## What it does\n..." }
```

An anchor is `entity:value`. A value containing spaces is quoted. A bare term with no `entity:`
is looked up across both entities and accepted only when exactly one record matches; on more
than one the candidates come back and nothing is loaded. The tool does not score, weigh or
choose.

A note attached to several tasks arrives under each of their anchors. The same markdown showing
up twice in one session is the relation working, not a duplicate.

`rekall_wrapup` is narrower on purpose. `rekall_context` may be handed a company and will
happily return everything under it; a write cannot, because a project names forty tasks and
none of them is the answer. Anything that does not resolve to exactly one task is refused with
the form that would have worked, and an ambiguous bare label is reported rather than picked.
The tool description carries the state-not-process rule, because that description is the only
part of this system the model reads before deciding what to write.

Responses are capped, with an explicit truncation notice rather than a silent cut.

### Two protocol eras

MCP has two revisions in play, split at `2026-07-28`. Up to `2025-11-25` a client opens with an
`initialize` handshake and the agreed revision holds for the session. From `2026-07-28` there is
no handshake and no session: every request carries its own revision, in the
`MCP-Protocol-Version` header and again in `params._meta`, along with its method in `Mcp-Method`
and, for a `tools/call`, its tool name in `Mcp-Name`.


| | Handshake era | Stateless era |
|---|---|---|
| Opens with | `initialize`, answered with the revision asked for | nothing |
| Unknown method | `-32601` on a 200 | `-32601` on a 404, so a probe can tell this from a wrong address |
| Unknown revision | — | `-32022` on a 400, listing what is supported |
| `server/discover` | answered | answered, and mandatory |
| Result envelope | a result is a result | every result carries `resultType`, and one without it is discarded |
| `tools/list` | the tools | the tools plus `ttlMs` and `cacheScope`, both required |

The last two rows are the ones that fail silently, and they fail in the same place. A `tools/list`
missing `resultType`, or missing either cache annotation, is not repaired or read leniently: it is
thrown away whole, and a client that cannot read the tool list registers no tools. The server
shows as connected, `/rk` is there, and there is nothing behind it to call. `server/discover` is
the exception that hides this, because its own schema defaults both annotations.


---

## 7. Write safety

`rekall-mcp` has no controller, no `CatalogService` and no `DocumentService` on its classpath.
The one write service it can reach, `WrapupService`, takes a task and a body and can do nothing
else — it cannot create, rename or delete any record, and cannot touch a note. Every read runs
under `@Transactional(readOnly = true)`, so Hibernate will not flush. `McpTool.writes()` is
declared rather than inferred, and the startup log names the write surface out loud.

The residual risk is real and small: Claude can overwrite one task's wrapup with something
wrong, or with something that replaces a correction made by hand. The first is repaired by
writing it again; the second is announced in the tool's answer, because nothing keeps a copy.
What it cannot do is lose a note, move a task or delete anything.

### Opening a session from a button

**Open in Claude Code**, on a task or a project, opens a terminal in that project's folder with
`/rk` already running. It answers the last thing the anchor chips could not: an anchor still has
to be pasted somewhere, and that somewhere has to be the right directory, because Claude Code
takes the folder it was launched from and keeps it for the session. So the folder is a column on
the project, `repo_folder`, and it travels down onto every task response beside the project label
those rows already carry.

It is a bridge in the macOS launcher (`packaging/macos/ClaudeCodeLauncher.swift`), next to the
folder chooser, and not an endpoint. A `POST /api/launch` on 47355 would be reachable by any page
open in any browser on the machine, which makes a button that starts a terminal into a way to
start one without a click. Through the WebView, only this application can call it.

The page never names a command either. It sends a folder, an anchor and one flag; the folder has
to exist, the anchor has to be `entity:value` characters and nothing a shell reads as a command,
and the line is assembled on the native side. A note rendered in that window is markdown someone
else may have written, and it is one XSS away from being the caller.

The terminal is launched by opening a short script with it rather than by scripting the terminal
itself. AppleEvents would put a "Rekall wants to control Terminal" prompt in front of a button
whose whole point is that it is one click, and would fail silently for anyone who declines. The
script removes itself, `cd`s and `exec`s, so nothing is left behind and closing the window ends
the session and nothing else.

`--dangerously-skip-permissions` is a switch in Settings, off until it is turned on, and it is
kept in the browser's storage rather than in the database: "run without asking" is a property of
this terminal on this machine, and a database opened somewhere else has no business carrying that
answer along with it.

---

### Export

`GET /api/export` returns the whole database as a zip of folders, `project/task/note.md`.

The tree cannot represent a note attached to several tasks, so the note is written under each
of them and `MANIFEST.md` records which files are copies of one row. Writing it once with
pointers would produce a tree that only Rekall can read, which defeats the purpose: the format
has to survive the application being abandoned.

A task's wrapup is written as `WRAPUP.md` beside its notes: in capitals and first in the
folder, because on a tree someone opens two years from now it is the file that says what the
thing was.

Folders are named after the label, which is the name that is already an identifier and the one
the manifest's anchors carry, so a folder can be matched to a `/rk` line without guessing.
Labels are sanitised into folder names rather than escaped: a project called `../../etc`
becomes a folder, never a path, and a test asserts no entry in the archive contains `..`.
